 Playground Request For Comments - Protocol for Excessively Informative
                 Reliable Communication (PEIRC) (Lab#2)

Abstract

   This Playground RFC describes the Protocol for Excessively
   Informative Reliable Communication (PEIRC) on the Transport Layer of
   a network.  PEIRC aims to reduce some of the vulnerabilities,
   ambiguities, and inefficiencies of TCP by providing several extra
   pieces of information in each message that are used to make
   congestion control decisions on both ends of a connection, while also
   helping participants detect and diagnose the source of these issues.

Status of this Memo

   This document specifies a Playgrounds standards track protocol for
   the Playground Experiment, and requests discussion and suggestions
   for improvements.  Distribution of this memo is unlimited.

1.  Introduction

   Protocol for Excessively Informative Reliable Communication (PEIRC)
   is a Transport Layer protocol based on TCP which is intended as an
   overlay over the Playground network.  PEIRC aims to reduce some of
   the vulnerabilities, ambiguities, and inefficiencies of TCP by
   providing several extra pieces of information that are used to make
   congestion control decisions on both ends of a connection, while also
   helping participants detect and diagnose the source of these issues.
   It uses intelligent timestamps and numbering to maintain order,
   confirm receipt and integrity of messages, and detect inconsistencies
   and issues.


2.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].


3.  Security Considerations

   This specification is a documentation standard and not directly
   related to the technical security of any protocol.


4.  Normative References
